    distributed across the Earth and solar system to model and
    understand the linear/nonlinear drivers of complex, physical
    systems.
  \item The product development included statistical and physical model
    selection, new interpretations of results commonly understood as
    anomalies found in the empirical spatial distribution, hypothesis
    testing, and development of dynamic correlation metrics which verified 
    time-varying causal relationships 
    \href{http://kevin-urban.com/images/dynamic-correlograms.pdf}

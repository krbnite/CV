# Jane Street
## Jane Street: Machine Learning Researcher

\$250,000 - \$300,000, Hybrid

**About the Position**

Machine learning is a critical pillar of Jane Street\'s global business,
and our ever-changing trading environment serves as a unique,
rapid-feedback platform for ML experimentation.

Researchers at Jane Street are responsible for building models,
strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial
instruments. As a mix of the trading and software engineering roles,
this work involves many things: analyzing large datasets, building and
testing models, creating new trading strategies, and writing the code
that implements them.

We're looking for people to join the research team with deep ML
experience in either an applied or academic context. A good candidate
should have a deep understanding of a wide variety of ML techniques, and
a passion for tinkering with model architectures, feature
transformations, and hyperparameters to generate robust inferences. We
also want people who are good communicators, with the ability to quickly
absorb the context of a new problem, carefully consider tradeoffs, and
recommend possible solutions.

As an ML researcher, your expertise will also shape the firm\'s future
ML developments including hiring new ML researchers, attending
conferences, teaching techniques to teammates, and setting firmwide
goals.

Base salary is \$250,000 - \$300,000. Base salary is only one part of
Jane Street total compensation, which includes an annual discretionary
bonus.

## Jane Street: Statistical Arbitrage Researcher
\$250,000 - \$300,000, Hybrid

**About the Position**

We are looking for a Statistical Arbitrage Researcher who is excited to
apply rigorous math and statistical methods to analyze a variety of
input datasets to create novel alpha-focused trading strategies for Jane
Street. Your work has the potential to span across any and all liquid
asset classes, including, but not limited to, U.S. and global equities,
equity and fixed income futures, FX, and corporate bonds.

Ideally, you will have previous experience working in a buy-side or
sell-side financial firm with some combination of asset price returns
data, non-returns-based traditional data, and "alternative" data sets.
However, if you are an economist or data scientist in a different field
(such as tech) we're open to teaching you what you need to know to
thrive in this role.

We are looking for someone who is eager to dig deep into the details of
data sets to assess quality and consider outliers, dimensionality,
feature engineering, causality, aligning dates across datasets, and
more.

You'll help us stay vigilant in our efforts to find and correct errors
or mistakes in code, which inevitably happen --- though we expect this
role to involve as much time delving into the lovely messiness and
complexity of data as it will on advanced statistical modeling.

The problems we work on rarely have clean, definitive answers, and they
often require insights from people across the firm with different areas
of expertise. We find that we make the most progress when team members
collaborate and communicate fluidly. Your success in this role will
depend on your ability to balance expertise and intellectual rigor with
an open mind to a variety of techniques and modes of thinking.

We don't believe in "one-size-fits-all" solutions; we are open to and
excited about applying all different types of mathematical and
statistical techniques, depending on what best fits a given problem.
Progress takes place at different tempos on our team depending on the
project, so you'll need to be comfortable embracing both large leaps and
incremental steps forward.

**About You**

-   2-6 years of professional experience working in a data-rich
    environment in quantitative research

-   Team player with a highly collaborative mindset; communicates
    clearly and often and enjoys discussing research ideas and results
    in depth

-   Open to a variety of techniques and modes of thinking

-   Humble about what you do and don't know; willing to admit mistakes

-   Enjoys learning new skills and teaching others what you know

-   Able to write code and analyze large datasets

-   Background knowledge of financial markets is a plus

Base salary is \$250,000 - \$300,000. Base salary is only one part of
Jane Street total compensation, which includes an annual discretionary
bonus.

The DS roles sound interest me less. The ML roles sound exciting, but
also might be considered a stretch...which means I should go for
"Senior" not "Staff", which leaves "Ads Prediction" and "Core Relevance"
...... Ads Prediction is probably a "better fit" in terms of how
demanding the qualifications are... But "Core Relevance" is more
interesting...

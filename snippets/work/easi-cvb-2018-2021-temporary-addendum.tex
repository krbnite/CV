Research and development efforts at the intersection of sensors, deep
learning, and brain health. 
This includes the design and testing of signal processing and machine learning 
pipelines on out-of-lab, ''real world'' sensor datasets, including devies such as 
wearables, mobile phones, and smart home tech, as well as in-lab medical
devices. The devices collect raw sensor data from 
one or more sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, PPG,
heart rate, EDA/GSR, EEG, temperature). The overarching theme across multiple
brain-health domains I work on (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Rett syndrome, PTSD, TBI, 
suicide) is to detect, classify, track, and/or predict semantically-meaningful 
features related to physical activity, sleep quality, symptoms, disease 
progression, and brain/mental health (e.g., human activity recognition, gesture recognition, 
symptom monitoring, clinical scale estimation/forecasting), and to do
this in an objective, consistent, high-frequency manner. These projects
often include more traditional measures and datasets as well, such as
clinical scales, neurocognitive tests, health records, demographics, 
brain imaging, etc.

Other activities include project management, help with grant writing,
mentoring, landscaping and literature reviews, poster presentations, 
and publishing (several papers in early stages of peer review 
process).

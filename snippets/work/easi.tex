    {\textbf{Management}}
    * developed data science cookiecutter project template
    * Helped write grant and secure funding for machine learning / suicide
    initiative with Office of Naval Research, Army Analytics Group, and
    University of Virginia
    * helped junior data scientist w/ predictive modeling project by
    introducing him to Box-Cox transformations...

    {\textbf{Gestures}}
    * Research into zero- and one-shot learning, and how they may help the
    gestures project
    * identified sources of data leakage in gestures data splitting
    strategy
    * * gestures data processing pipeline;  fixed leakage;  added many
    more patient

    {\textbf{Partnered with clinical care network}}
    * helped develop project map for suicide/self-harm research and detection
    efforts; * developed causal and predictive models for patient
    dropout
    * began working on TEDS-D SUD data set for dropout model
    * how to deal w/ missing values in predictive models
    * developed predictive and causal goals with CVN statistician* how
    to measure model performance on model predictions that are intended
    to be undone?* how to understand causal effects?

    {\small{Neo4j, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, etc}} \\  
    * Reviewed the functionality and pros/cons of graph (Neo4j,
      AgensGraph, AWS Neptune), document (MongoDB), relational (MySQL,
      Postgres, TimeScaleDB), and key-value (Redis, DynamoDB) databases,
      as well as enhanced AWS cloud offerings, such as RDS, Athena, and
      Aurora
    * Designed several iterations of schema (e.g., entity relationship
      diagrams, document-oriented schema, and graph models)
    * Identified graph databases as providing the best support for 
      many-to-many/any-to-any relationships inherent in our concept
      mappings
    * Demonstrated the simplified nature of querying via Cypher from Neo4j 
    * Mapped queries of interest to Cypher...

    {\textbf{Landscaping and Literature Review: Suicide and Self-Harm Predictors and Risk Factors}}
    {\small{}} \\  
    * Developed domain expertise in suicidal ideation and behaviors
    * Synthesized and reported on the state-of-the-art modeling efforts from several
      siloed communities of research, including efforts involving
      wearable and mobile phone sensors, electronic health records,
      brain imaging, paralinguistics, natural language processing, 
      neurocognitive tests, clinical instruments
      (questionnaires) used for screening, diagnosing, and monitoring
      patients 
    * * wrote suicide review paper (then let it collect dust)
    * Suicide report to white house (Request for Information, RFI);
    review of suicide detection methods (data types (brain imaging,
    scales, neurocog tests, EHRs, mobile phones / wearables, etc),
    models)  (In response to:  Executive Order (EO) 13861 (the
    President’s Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy
    of Suicide or PREVENTS), On signed on March 5, 2019)

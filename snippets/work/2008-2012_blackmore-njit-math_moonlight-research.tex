\textit{Research Scientist, Mathematical Modeling} 
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Guided exploration into the applications of advanced mathematical
    disciplines, such as dynamical systems, topology, differentiable
    manifolds, abstract algebra, and group theory.
  \item Derivation, numerical simulation, and visualization of
    dynamical system model representations of granular fluid systems
  \item Projection of high-dimensional dynamical models into
    reduced parameter spaces to aid in the investigation, numerical simulation,
    and visualization of chaotic regimes and sources of instability
    in such systems (e.g., via Poincare maps)
  \item Remedial investigation into the propagation of numerical errors in
    simulated dynamical models, which obfuscate the underlying dynamical model
    and, ultimately, prevent a faithful visualizion the system dynamics
  \item Co-authorship of four peer-reviewed papers on dynamical systems
    models of granular fluids, including one that explores potential
    applications of an esoteric field of mathematics known as fractional
    calculus
  \item All numerical models and visualizations developed in R and
    MatLab
  \item All visualizations presented as time sequences of 1D, 2D,
    and/or 3D model representations (i.e., movies); publication figures
    resulted from select snapshots.
\end{itemize*}

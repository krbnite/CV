\textit{Intern}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Collaboration with a team of engineers and scientists in the
    development and study of a mission design concept for the journey to
    and study of the Jovian Trojan asteroids 
  \item Identification and prioritization of targeted science goals
  \item Real-time consideration and optimization of resources via
    concurrent engineering systems and principles, e.g., trade-offs
    within the science-engineering-financial parameter space (subsystem
    design constraints, trajectory optimizations, cost-benefit analyses of
    scientific priorities, timeline requirements, budget forecasting,
    etc)
  \item Project management techniques, such as Gannt charts,
    traceability matrices, technology readiness levels,
    best-case and threshold-case scenarios (i.e., desired mission
    specifications versus minimum requirements)
  \item Co-authorship of a formal proposal and presentation of our mission
    design to the NASA review board
  \item Co-authorship of peer-reviewed manuscript documenting lessons
    learned and feasibility considerations
  %\item
  %  Gained understanding of the interplay between the trajectory design
  %  and other considerations, such as launch
  %  windows, budget time lines, a multi-component propulsion system,
  %  and payload
  %\item 
  %  Helped develop the science time line and traceability matrix for the
  %  baseline (desired) and threshold (minimum requirement) missions

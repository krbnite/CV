Description:

1st Prize (with A.J. Teti) for  conceptualization and prototyping 
of "HooknUp.Net," a fish-identification-and-social-media app
envisioned to to help marine scientists track fish populations
by bootstrapping into an expert-level, automated
identification/tracking tool in multiple phases. Gamification: local
fisherman are encouraged to photograph and identify each fish
they catch, and when possible (e.g., measurements taken manually or 
by un-networked devices) any additional metadata, such as 
weight, length, ambient/water temp, catch depth, etc. Each photo 
is automatically geo-tagged, time-stamped, and associated
with any additional parameters automatically collectible by the HooknUp.Net 
app. In return, each photo earns the fisherman a "Bragging Right," more of which 
can be earned (or lost!) in daily competitions and by social metrics 
(likes/dislikes, shares, comments). On the backend, Bragging
Rights can be further earned/lost via crowd-evaluated identification
assessments (correct/incorrect), which include "Baloney Flags" (e.g., 
illegitimate photos, obvious measurement lies, etc; voters are weighted 
by a trust score (based on historical accuracy); expert validation 
by registered marine scientists is typically given higher weight
(and specifically sought after). This process serves to grow a supervised 
dataset, which is then used to train a deep learning-based
computer vision module that can be used to automatically assess
incoming images.

There you have it, folks!  

Any and all signal comes from Nico's alcsmk table, which is an imputed data table
based on raw alcohol and smoking variables... Columbia wanted us to use it....but it looks
like it has a lot of issues.  The main one is that any pre-term (event) has missing
cigarette vars.  This is the majority of the signal -- basically the answer key.

Why?

We don't know...but it doesn't make for a great model unless it really means something
interesting biologically....  Moreover, being an imputed data table, the point was 
basically to remove missing values.......yet there are still missing values?

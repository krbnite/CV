    "who had BISH records w/ GA > 34 weeks, which basically means he was no longer attempting to\n",
    "predict pre-term births so much...  \n",
    "\n",
    "The BISH file is a disaster though, and one of the ways this disaster manifests is GAs\n",
    "that go well beyond 40 weeks.  Udi noticed this too, evidenced by throwing out any\n",
    "`time_left` instances that were negative (in other words, the BISH file's GA for the\n",
    "F3 measurment was somehow greater than the GA at birth quoted in another data table).\n",
    "\n",
    "The disaster that is the BISH file goes beyond this though.  For example, in the file, there\n",
    "include \"filename\" variables, which a strings incorporating the site (BISH), the patient ID,\n",
    "the cycle ID, and so on.  Cycle IDs 10, 15, and 20 are basically supposed to correspond with\n",
    "F1, F2, and F3, respectively.  However, \n",
    "* the GA generally extends outside the definitions (F1: 20-24wks, F2: 28-32wks, F3: 34+wks)\n",
    "    - this could make sense in that the tests can be scheduled at 25 wks or 29 wks, in \n",
    "      which case you might think they just get labeled with the cycle ID that makes most sense; however,\n",
    "      things get messier\n",
    "* in the BISH file, cycle ID and Fx definitions do not strictly coincide\n",
    "    - you will notice CID 10, 15, and 20 have GAs ranging over 18-38 wks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `CID-Fx Discrepancy` section below, you will find that \n",
    "* CID 10 has values less than 20 weeks and more than 30 weeks\n",
    "* CID 20 has at least 60 values that are less than 34 weeks (than values going up to ~48 weeks)\n",
    "* CID 15 is the worst:  most of its values (~75%) are less than 24 weeks (28 weeks is the supposed \n",

    "  \n",
    "<b id=\"redcell\">This makes CID a useless way of ordering by time.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to use the BISH file, we would want to instead make a new system that\n",
    "ordered test times into chunks... Kind of like Fx nomenclature does, but a little\n",
    "more lenient (e.g., G1: 16-24wks, G2:25-33wks, G3:34+wks).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**HOWEVER, my 2 cents**:  since both TOI and MON data seem to have associated Fx labels\n",
    "of some sort (either in the variable name or in an associated column), let's just stick\n",
    "to the Fx nomenclature and trust that these files were put together ok...  BUT\n",
    "ONLY FOR THE TIME BEING.  If this project is to continue, we need to get a better understanding\n",
    "of these discrepancies and inconsistencies...  It's possible Udi/Carlos did not understand the\n",

    "**Some patients have only 1 records**, which is understandable: my interpretation is that they did sensor tests on one occasion, either during F1, F2, or F3. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Other patients have 2 or 3 records**, which again is pretty understandable: they have sensor measurements during multiple Fx periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "**But some patients have 4-5 records** in the BISH file -- **WHY?** Were they really tested on this many occasions?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions led me to realize that I do not understand the BISH file. For example, maybe 5 records means that a patient recorded MON data on 2 occasions and TOI data on 3 other occasions. Maybe one record means they got both MON and TOI testing on the same occasion. But maybe not. There does not seem to be any indication in the BISH file. To really understand more about the patients, we would have to do a lot of exploratory querying that we don't exactly have time for..."

    "In the intervening time, Dani has helped put together a v4 of the data dictionary.  Here is a list\n",
    "of things that have been decided that help paint where this project is going:\n",
    "* Dani worked on preparing the dataset over the holiday break\n",
    "    - she asked Nico to remind her what CCGA stands for\n",
    "    - she went without excluding BMI and GA at recruitment\n",
    "    - the goal is to only use data before week 25\n",
    "    - she told Columbia that we will try to predict labor day (knowing it will likely not work), then \n",
    "      move on to a binary classification (delivery before or after 28 week)\n",
    "      * notably, she left out the binned regression concept, which is something I still think we should do\n",
    "    - she asked Nico for his most recent alcohol-smoking imputed data\n",
    "    - she asked David and Nico to look over her v4 list of variables for approval/rejection\n",
    "* David responded about CCGA: \"CCGA is the Gestational Age (days) calculated by Clinical Coordinator at recruitment.\"\n",
    "* Nico responded about CCGA: \n",
    "    - CCGA is variable \"C\" from table \"ADELIG\" with definition \"GA (days) calculated by CC at recruitment\"\n",
    "    - Why CCGA: \"We thought that could have been a good variable to start screening for those subject enrolled in \n",
    "      the study later before (or after) 25 weeks.\"\n",
    "* Notes about the v4 data dictionary (from Dani):\n",
    "    - In the Excel file, the colors indicate if a variable is a predictor (green) or something else (magenta), where\n",
    "      \"something else\" can be a target variable or a stratification/cutoff variable (magenta)\n",
    "    - there is a column that says if a variable is included in our final data set or not (it should match \n",
    "      colored variables, but trust the column if there is a discrepancy)\n",
    "* Nico helped update v4 data dictionary \n",
    "    - added his updated alcohol/smoking vars\n",
    "    - noted several potentially concerning vars that might represent a potential for data leakage\n",
    "        * Methamphetamine Use in Trimester 2 (15 to 28 Weeks)\n",
    "        * Marijuana Use in Trimester 2 (15 to 28 Weeks)\n",
    "        * Other Drug Use in Trimester 2 (15 to 28 Weeks)\n",

    "          accurate... **NOTE2SELF: I think we can transform the T2_Alc variable into \"weekly average during T2”\n",
    "          by dividing it by 13, which is something that could still be derived by a clinician at 25 weeks \n",

    "Any time I created a \"relative band power\" variable set, I also\n",
    "left the regular \"band power\" variables in the sensor data set.  A few things about this:\n",
    "* the regular band power variables are considered low quality because the magnitudes\n",
    "  can be dependent on device, device placement, and other conditions; this is why we create\n",
    "  the relative band power quantities -- they strip out the arbitrariness in magnitude, while\n",
    "  maintaining the morphology\n",
    "* though the regular band power quantities contain some orthogonal information (e.g., assuming\n",
    "  the artifact effects aren't too big, then the magnitude information would indeed be orthogonal\n",
    "  to the relative band powers and so would be an important consideration in a model), it is likely\n",
    "  that they contain a lot of correlated information to the relative band powers -- and, if so, would\n",
    "  reduce the variable importances for both sets of variables (\"importance sharing\")\n",
    "\n",

    "However, as far as I'm currently aware, the RBP model would be the most trustworthy.  If we see\n",
    "much better results with the BP model, then we should consult further with Columbia to discern whether\n",
    "it's worth caring about (or somehow just a spurious result).\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Power:  when creating the relative band power quantities, I first defined \"total band power\"\n",
    "quantities that I also left in the variable set.  If these spectral powers follow power-law distributions,\n",
    "then this quantity very likely is highly correlated with the lowest frequency band, thus should\n",

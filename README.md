For WWE and Early Signal, I wrote my CV in LaTeX (for the most part; seems
like I had to convert it to DOCX for something as well).  

For some roles earlier on, especially any post-docs, a full-on super-long 
CV made sense.  However, when applying for industry roles, some of the 
additional nonsense (e.g., every poster I was ever listed on, teaching 
experience, etc) didn't make sense, so I wanted a shorter version.

When creating the shorter version, I realized that different roles and
applications would be best suited by slightly different CV styles, e.g.,
where each section was placed or what content was included.  

Fortunately, I recalled
how I'd made my dissertation in LaTeX, where the main file was essentially
a table of contents and the content itself was housed in separate .tex
files (where the parent file is explicitly listed at the top of the 
content file).  I re-implemented this style (and the use of the LaTeX
add-on called TeX-9) for working on my CV ever after -- long or short!

However, there has been one major short-coming: each time I change the
main file, it is "forever changed."  

An obvious solution is to create a new "main file" for each CV I 
generate.  

There is also another thread I developed over the years: working
more exclusively in MarkDown files rather than using LaTeX at 
all.  I mean, LaTeX is great for people who like pain and torture,
but MarkDown is great for anyone!  :-p

Not sure exactly how I will change things up, but I def want to 
end this current style by packing it away into a legacy branch 
(`v1-2019`) and giving myself a fresh start.  (I've added a 
few things to this repo since 2019; at the least, an "Addendum"
that covers some EaSi/CVB work. However, it wasn't directly added
to the CV...  The last CV I really worked on was circa 2019 when
I considered trying something new...before staying another couple
years.)

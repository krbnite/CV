\textit{Intern, Trajectory Optimization / Design} 
\begin{itemize*}
  \item
    Collaborated with a team of engineers and scientists to develop a full-fledged spacecraft mission to
    the Trojan asteroids of Jupiter
    (from % responding to an Announcement of Opportunity [AO]
    establishing and prioritizing science goals, to optimizing the science-engineering-financial
    parameter space, to the written proposal and presenting our mission design to the NASA review
    board)
  \item 
    Gained an appreciation of rapid product development via concurrent
    engineering, and an understanding of the intricate interplay between the
    various engineering system designs, science goals, timeline
    requirements, and budget constraints.
  \item Published peer-reviewed paper documenting lessons learned
  %\item
  %  Gained understanding of the interplay between the trajectory design
  %  and other considerations, such as launch
  %  windows, budget time lines, a multi-component propulsion system,
  %  and payload
  %\item 
  %  Helped develop the science time line and traceability matrix for the
  %  baseline (desired) and threshold (minimum requirement) missions

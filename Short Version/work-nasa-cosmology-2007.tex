\textit{Intern, Observational Cosmology Laboratory} 
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Developed software implementing a Stokes parameter analysis to
    run on simulation data for the proposed Absolute Spectrum
    Polarimeter [ASP] --- an instrument designed to detect B-mode
    gravitational waves, which would provide evidence for Einstein's
    theory of general relativity and cosmological inflationary theory
  \item Worked with multiple programming languages, including MatLab,
    Bash (shell scripting), and IDL 
  % \item Studied cosmology as it related to the mission goals of ASP
\end{itemize*}

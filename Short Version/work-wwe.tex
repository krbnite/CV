\textit{Data Scientist, Advanced Analytics} 
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Lead on numerous business-driven analytics research and
    predictive modeling projects for WWE Network -- an
    over-the-top (OTT) content distribution network  that can be
    described as ``Netflix for Wrestling'' and currently supports nearly
    2 million active users, generating 1-3 million new rows of viewership/behavioral 
    data in Redshift database every day
  \item Experimentation and development of machine learning pipelines
    in Python / Scikit-Learn (preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction) and 
    deep neural network models in Keras and TensorFlow 
    on AWS EC2 Linux/GPU instance for a handful of projects related customer segmentation, churn, 
    and lifetime value (multilayer perceptrons, autoencoders, recurrent
    neural networks) 
  \item  Development of wrestler image recognition algorithm (transfer learning,
    convolutional neural networks)
  \item  Spectral analyses of customer churn/winback behaviors 
    to enhance customer segmentation efforts, help advise email campaigns, and
    improve churn/winback forecasting 
  \item Development of ensemble approach to revenue attribution models for WWE Network content
    driven by viewership behaviour at the customer level (analysis of
    over a billion rows of data in Redshift)
  \item  Fusion of fan panel / survey response data with customer accounts on the
    WWE Network to better quantify the relationship between
    subjective responses and objective viewership data
  \item Natural language processing (sentiment analysis) of customer cancellation surveys
    and social media content to uncover resolvable issues and inform on
    how to better serve our customer base
  \item  Decision tree analyses to help understand and segment
    customers by WWE content and character preferences
  \item Design of interactive dashboards in Tableau to help interested
    parties explore our data assets

\begin{itemize*}
  \item Research into and documentation of available web APIs to enhance 
    WWE's data collection in terms of volume (e.g., all instead of some), 
    cadence (e.g., by the minute or hour when relevant, as opposed to just
    a daily load), variety (e.g., countless metrics and user data 
    opportunities that were not yet being leveraged), and independence from 
    expensive 3rd party vendors
  \item Implementation and automation of critical web APIs (YouTube Reporting, 
    YouTube Analytics, YouTube Data; Google Client; FaceBook Graph for 
    Page Insights, Video Insights,
    Post Insights, Instant Articles, Live Video, Facebook Watch, 
    Instagram) 
  \item Automation of headless web browsers (using Selenium, Chrome,
    BeautifulSoup, and Cron) to scrape JavaScript-heavy website
    and provide daily/hourly collection and
    ingestion of data sets (e.g., social, engagement, viewership), 
    not available through official APIs
  \item  Automation of report generation, email, and analytic work flows
    through the development of project-agnostic and project-specific R packages 
    and python scripts 
  \item Emphasis on Hive/Presto connections to data collections in S3 instead
    of putting everything into Redshift, which is timely, more expensive, and
    often has to first go through S3 anyway
\end{itemize*}

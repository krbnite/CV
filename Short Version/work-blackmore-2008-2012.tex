\textit{Research Scientist, Mathematical Modeling} 
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Developed dynamical system models for granular fluid systems
  \item Simulated and visualized the dynamical models in MatLab and R

    %{\textsuperscript{\tiny{[link]}}} 
  \item Investigated sources of chaos and instability in such systems
    by projecting them into a dimensionally-reduced parameter space 
    and coding simulations of their Poincare maps in R 
    %(e.g., via \href{http://kevin-urban.com/video/R__gamma-var_restitution-0.8.gif}{Poincare
    %map simulations in R \textsuperscript{\tiny{[link]}}})
  \item Led effort in understanding and controlling the propagation of numerical errors, 
    which otherwise prevent proper quantitative analysis and
    visualization of the underlying dynamical system
  \item Co-authored four peer-reviewed papers numerically modeling,
    visualizing, and analyzing granular fluid systems
  \item Led research on potential engineering applications of fractional calculus and
    co-authored peer-reviewed publication 
  \item Explored real-world applications of advanced mathematical disciplines such as
    dynamical systems, topological analysis, manifold theory, abstract
    algebra, stochastic calculus

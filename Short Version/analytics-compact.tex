Structured \& Unstructured Data (e.g., sensors,
scientific instrumentation, spacecraft, 
images, text, time series, geospatial, simulation, 
marketing, viewership, commerce, HTML, JSON, XML, social media);
Data Pre-Processing (e.g., table joins, up/down sampling, outlier 
detection, imputation, aggregation, feature selection / engineering /
extraction, regex and rules-based scrubbing / transformations);
Probability \& Statistics (e.g., inference,
hypothesis testing, resampling, conditioning, error analysis);
Machine Learning (e.g., neural networks,
deep learning, CNNs, RNNs, reinforcement learning, statistical
models, regression, classification, clustering, prediction,
PCA, LDA, decision trees, random forests, sentiment analysis,
natural language processing);
Time Series Analysis (e.g., parametric, nonparametric, spectral
analysis, digital signal processing, digital filtering, forecasting,
wavelets);
Numerical Modeling
(e.g., difference equations, numerical derivatives, numerical
integration, linear/nonlinear models, dynamical systems, numerical stability, 
eigenvalue estimation)
